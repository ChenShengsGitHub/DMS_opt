This github repository should be used to store and share useful scripts and analysis steps for the DMS+ML project.

## Repository Structure

The scripts folder should contain useful helper scripts that we want to reuse  several times. It also includes the data.py file which contains a fixed train/test split of the dataset. The data can be loaded via:
```python
from scripts.data import dms23

# The train fold can be accessed like this (and is stored as a pandas dataframe)
dms23.train

# Test fold
dms23.test

# Complete dataset
dms23.complete

```
The notebook directory contains all the results for each individual model. Eventually, we could create a summary file and put this in the main directory. The data folder contains the original .csv file Derek sent around. References can be used to store papers or documentation files of individual packages. The figures folder can be used to store figures produced during any of the analysis steps.

## Prepare working environment

In order to ensure that we are using the same packages and package versions, I suggest that we use conda as our environment + package manager. Conda makes it easy to load an environment from .yaml files via the following command:

```
conda env create -f config.yaml -n $Project_Name 
```

You can then load your new environment using:

```
source activate $Project_Name
```

If you want to install a new package, you can install it via conda like this:

```
conda install $PackageName
```

If you updated you environment, update the .yaml file via:

```
conda env export > config.yaml
```

And push your new .yaml file to the repository. Just notify the rest of us on slack so that we can update our environments as well. I already included many packages in the original .yaml file, but feel free to add more packages if you need them.

```
source activate $Project_Name
conda env update -f=config.yaml
```
